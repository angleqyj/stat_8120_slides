page 43 \nu \times G should be \nu \otimes G
page 213, ...is an unbiased estimate of mu(f)... correction: self-normalized estimator is biased
page 232, equation 7.32, the RN derivatives should be evaluated at xi_l not xi_k (both numerator and denominator)
page 233, equation 7.34 the square bracketed term should not be squared
page 306, "Under the stated assumptions, Proposition 9.2.11" should be "Under the stated assumptions, Theorem 9.2.11"
page 338, This follows from induction the last product should be z_2' \cdots z_m' instead of z_1' \cdots z_m'
page 339, the proof is adapted from Theorem 27.2 in Billingsley, not Theorem 27.1
page 321, "The instrumental distributions are defined by a sequence"... with R_k, the k \ge 1 not k \ge 0
page 321, In assumption 9.4.1(ii) k \ge 1 not k \ge 0
page 322, Not really a typo, but the i index should be changed to a j index to prevent confusion withthe first mention of $\tilde{\xi}^{N,i}_{k+1}$
page 322, not sure if this is a typo, but they might be overusing the j index for the probability of drawing index j in the selection part of the algorithm
page 338, the one line in the proof of Lemma 9.5.8 has a z_1' instead of a z_2'
page 340: These two result[s] suffice to finish the proof.
page 341: I was not able to prove Proposition 9.5.12 with the stated assumptions. However, it only seems to be used in proving 9.5.13, and I was able to prove 9.5.13 directly (using 9.5.9)
page 288: In Theorem 9.1.2 it should be |f|mu << nu (not |f|mu << |f|nu)
page 288: In last equation, the right hand side is greater than or equal to (not equal to) the right hand side. Once you put the absolute value sign around f, it makes that rndom variable smaller variance.
page 316: it reads "For the selection/mutation algorithm, we have to strengthen the assump-
tion on the transition kernel L." However, we were already assuming this (and more) for the previous algorithm in Assumption 9.3.1.
