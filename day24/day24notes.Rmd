## Roadmap

9.2

- sampling importance resampling/IS with resampling/factored sampling 

9.3

- **sequential importance sampling with resampling (single-step analysis)**

9.4

- sequential importance sampling with resampling (multi-step analysis)


## Overview

Last class we added the last step in this diagram and proved our estimator is consistent.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="400px"}

```


Today we will show it is also asymptotically normal :)


## Theorem 9.3.12 assumptions and definitions


1. Assumption 9.3.1: $0 < L(x,\mathsf{X}) < \infty$.

2. Assumption 9.3.2: $\{(\xi^{N,i},1)\}_{1 \le i \le M_N}$ are consistent for $(\nu, \mathsf{C})$. $L(x,\mathsf{X}) \in \mathsf{C}$.

3. Assumption 9.3.3: $\forall x \in \mathsf{X}$, $L(x, \cdot) \ll R(x, \cdot)$, and there exists a strictly positive RN derivative: $\frac{dL(x,\cdot )}{dR(x, \cdot)}$.

4. Assumption 9.3.6 (new) $\{ (\xi^{N,i} , 1)\}_{1 \le i \le M_N}$ is asymptotically normal for $(\nu, \mathsf{A}, \sigma, \{M_N^{1/2}\})$, where $\mathsf{A}$ is a proper set, and $\sigma$ is a nonnegative function on $\mathsf{A}$.

5. unnamed Assumption (new) $\{\alpha_N\}$ has a possibly-infinite limit $\alpha$.

6. definition:
$$
\tilde{\mathsf{A}} = 
\left\{ 
f \in L^2(\mathsf{X}, \mu) : 
x \mapsto L(x,|f|) \in \mathsf{A},
x \mapsto \int R(x,dx') \left[ \frac{dL(x,\cdot)}{dR(x,\cdot)}(x') f(x')\right]^2 \in \mathsf{C}
\right\}
$$


## Theorem 9.3.12 consequences

1. $\tilde{\mathsf{A}}$ is proper

2. $\{(\tilde{\xi}^{N,j}, \tilde{\omega}^{N,i} ) \}_{1 \le j \le \tilde{M}_N}$ is asymptotically normal for $(\mu, \tilde{\mathsf{A}}, \tilde{\sigma}, \{M_N^{1/2}\})$ with
$$
\tilde{\sigma}(f)  =
\frac{\sigma^2\left( L[f-\mu(f)] \right) + \alpha^{-1} \eta^2\left(f - \mu(f) \right)}{[\nu L(\mathsf{X})]^2 }
$$

3. $\{ ( \check{\xi}^{N,i}, 1 )\}_{1 \le i \le \tilde{M}_N}$ is asymptotically normal for $(\mu, \tilde{\mathsf{A}}, \check{\sigma}, \{M_N^{1/2}\})$ with 
$$
\check{\sigma}(f) = 
\text{Var}_{\mu}(f) + \tilde{\sigma}(f) 
$$


## Theorem 9.3.12: proof 

To verify 1 and 2, use 9.3.7. 

9.3.7 was covered in day 22. 

***show side-by-side***


## Theorem 9.3.12: proof 

To verify 3, we can use either 9.2.14 or 9.5.13.

- 9.2.14 was covered in `day20notes.html`, and

- 9.5.13 was covered in `day14notes.html`.

We'll choose the latter. Even though it's more difficult, you see all the details again for the second time, which is better than memorizing theorem numbers and converting notation. 

For details see `second_half_9.3.12.pdf`
